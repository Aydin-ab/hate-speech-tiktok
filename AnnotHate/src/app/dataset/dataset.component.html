<div name="Why Annot'Hate ?" class="my-3">
    <h1>What is Annot'Hate</h1>
    <p>TikTok was launched to the international market in 2017 and
        thanks to its simple concept and GUI, it became very popular
        especially among teenagers. <br> 
        In effect, 
        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241788/tiktok-app-download-numbers-update-2-billion-users" 
            target="_blank"> 
            more than 2 billion downloads for the application were recorded in August 2020 
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p> Unfortunately, a lot of content on TikTok includes abusive
        language such as swear words, hate speech and racism, in
        addition to indecent behavior. 
        <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/hatescape-an-in-depth-analysis-of-extremism-and-hate- speech-on-tiktok/."
            target="_blank"> 
            An in-depth analysis
        </a> 
        was conducted on 1030 videos, an equivalent of almost 8-hour of
        content, and multiple aspects of extremism and hatred speech
        were depicted. 
    </p> 
    <p class="lead"> <i> By definition, a <b>hate speech</b> is an abusive
        or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice
        against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation. </i>
    </p>
    <p> The overall goal of this tool by 
        <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/en" 
            target="_blank">
            Eurecom
        </a> 
        is to label hate speech and abusive language in the content of videos downloaded from TikTok. 
        The label can be decided by analyzing the video content, the transcription of the audio content, 
        and video context such as username, hashtags and video description. 
        The focus of this tool is on the analysis of transcribed audio content.

<div name="Example" class="my-5">
    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <p> Example of labelling video contents. 
        Of course it might depends on your sensitivity but make sure that 1 means no hate speech at all
         and 5 means that it can't be more hateful
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"OMG I love you all" : <i><b>1</b></i>. Because this is not hate speech at all</li>
        <li>"I don't trust black people, they are very violent..." : <i><b>3</b></i>. This is offensive toward a group of people</li>
        <li>"F*ckin ni**** and jews, I wish we could exterminate all these fag***" : <i><b>5</b></i>. This is highly hateful </li>
    </ul>
